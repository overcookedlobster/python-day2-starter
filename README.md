# Day 2 Python: Loops & Guessing Game

Today you'll learn about one of the most powerful concepts in programming: loops! You'll practice with `for` and `while` loops, and then use them to build a fun guessing game.

## Sub-Task 1: Introduction to Loops
- **File to edit:** `subtask1_loops.py`
- **Goal:** Practice the syntax and application of `for` and `while` loops by completing the `TODO` items. You will print number sequences, iterate over a list, and calculate a sum.

## Sub-Task 2: Guessing Game
- **File to edit:** `subtask2_guessing_game.py`
- **Goal:** Build a complete program that uses a `while` loop, `if/elif/else` conditions, and user `input()` to create a number guessing game.

## Homework: Unit Converter
- **File to edit:** `homework_unit_converter.py`
- **Goal:** Create a useful, menu-driven unit converter. This program will run continuously until the user decides to quit. It will test your ability to combine loops, user input, and conditional logic.

## Instructions
1.  Complete the sub-tasks in order.
2.  Fill in the code where you see a `# TODO:` comment.
3.  Commit and push your code after completing each task to see your test results.
4.  All tests must pass for the assignment to be considered complete.

Good luck!
